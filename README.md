# Postman_Automation
This is a json file 

Import to Postman and run the Postman API collection. It consist of 6 methods. 

- POST Create a workspace
- PUT Update a workspace
- GET Get a workspace Pass
- GET Get a workspace Fail
- DELETE Delete a workspace
- GET Get all workspace

* Execute in that order, as there is a dependency in method responses. Variables are being stored when an API is executed.

You will need to generate a unique key from postman settings and store in your header and environment variable as “x-api-key’.
